Run from Exchange On-Prem server
Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\<StoreCertPath> | Export-Certificate -FilePath "C:\My Documents\Exported Certificate Store.sst" -Type SST

Run from Exchange Online PowerShell; This will import that cert grabbed in the last cmdlet and create a reference certificate in the cloud.
Set-SmimeConfig -SMIMECertificateIssuingCA ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('C:\My Documents\Exported Certificate Store.sst'))

==============================================
how to parse the byteArray back out of the EXO SMIME config, so we can validate what is in our SST:

$SMIME = Get-SMIMEConfig;
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("SST File Path", $SMIME.SMIMECertificateIssuingCA);

we also discussed that, by default, OWA expects the user's SMTP address (primary, or proxy)
to align with the leaf certificate's Subject or SAN.  
I expect this is what is blocking the DOD CAC scenario as it does not seem to align with the user address.  

To allow this scenario, you'll need to adjust the OWA mailbox policy as follows:

Set-OWAMailboxPolicy XXXXX -SMIMESuppressNameChecksEnabled $TRUE;
